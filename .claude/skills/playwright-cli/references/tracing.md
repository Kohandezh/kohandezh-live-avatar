# Tracing

Capture a detailed execution trace for debugging. A trace holds DOM snapshots,
screenshots, network activity and console logs for every step.

## From the CLI

```bash
playwright-cli tracing-start

playwright-cli open http://localhost:5273
playwright-cli fill "#user-input" "ساعت کاری نمایشگاه چیست؟"
playwright-cli click "#send-btn"

playwright-cli tracing-stop
```

## Output files

Tracing creates a `traces/` directory with:

### `trace-{timestamp}.trace`

The action log: every click, fill and navigation, a DOM snapshot before and after each
one, screenshots, timings, console messages and source locations.

### `trace-{timestamp}.network`

Every request and response, with headers, bodies, timing (DNS, connect, TLS, TTFB,
download), sizes, and failures.

### `resources/`

Cached images, fonts, stylesheets and scripts, so the page can be reconstructed on replay.

## What a trace captures

| Category | Details |
|---|---|
| Actions | Clicks, fills, hovers, keyboard input, navigations |
| DOM | Full snapshot before and after each action |
| Screenshots | Visual state at each step |
| Network | All requests, responses, headers, bodies, timing |
| Console | Every `console.log`, `warn` and `error` |
| Timing | Precise timing per operation |

## When to reach for it in this repo

**A click that does nothing.** The DOM snapshot at the moment of the click shows whether
the element was there, visible and hittable. The chat header lays itself out inside a
fixed frame, and buttons there can report as outside the viewport, which is why
`tests/e2e/test_chat_localisation.py` fires `#lang-btn` through `page.evaluate` instead
of a Playwright click. A trace is how you find out you are in that situation.

**A request that never arrives.** The network log shows whether the call was made, what
was sent, and what came back. Under `VITE_API_MOCK=true` the answer comes from
`src/data/mock`, so the trace is how you tell "the app never asked" from "the mock said
no".

**A screen that renders wrong only after several steps.** Step-by-step DOM replay beats
re-running the flow and hoping to catch the moment.

## In a spec

`playwright.config.ts` already sets `trace: 'on-first-retry'`, so a test that fails and
retries leaves a trace in `test-results/` with no extra code. That covers most cases.

To force one for a single run:

```bash
pnpm --filter @app/frontend exec playwright test --trace on tests/e2e/mobile.login.spec.ts
```

To capture one by hand inside a test:

```ts
test('...', async ({ browser }) => {
  const context = await browser.newContext();
  await context.tracing.start({ screenshots: true, snapshots: true, sources: true });
  const page = await context.newPage();
  // ... the failing steps ...
  await context.tracing.stop({ path: '/tmp/trace.zip' });
  await context.close();
});
```

Open it with:

```bash
pnpm --filter @app/frontend exec playwright show-trace /tmp/trace.zip
```

Write the trace to `/tmp` or the session scratchpad, never into the repo. Do not leave
tracing switched on in a committed test. It slows every run and CI does not read the
output.

## Practice

**Start tracing before the problem, not at it.** Trace the whole flow. The cause is
usually two steps earlier than the failure.

**Clean up.** Traces are large.

```bash
find .playwright-cli/traces -mtime +7 -delete
```

## Limits

- Tracing adds overhead.
- Large traces use significant disk space.
- Some dynamic content does not replay perfectly. Video playback in the avatar tab is one
  case: the trace shows the element and the network fetch, not the frames.
